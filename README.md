\subsection{Thoughts / Intentions}

\textbf{11:36am}: I just finished downloading Overleaf and began the Data Carpentry exercise for this week. Finding everything so far very overwhelming, but I am determined to succeed. 


\textbf{12:03p}: I decided to try out GitHub for a bit. I created my repository and get familiar with the Slack account as well, when I get the chance. So far, I feel pretty comfortable with these installations. 


\textbf{12:30pm}: I am now returning to Data Carpentry exercise for Monday.
